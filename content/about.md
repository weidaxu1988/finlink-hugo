Finlink Capital is founded by Chuck Li and David Xu, who are both cofounders of Bitlink Capital, in 2019.
We cover a variety of Defi and Cefi projects, especially trading related. Finlink now heavily invests
in exchanges, derivatives, fixed income, NFT and etc. Unlike many pure crypto VCs,
we utilize our high frequency trading skills to help our portfolios with world-class liquidity from day 1.
